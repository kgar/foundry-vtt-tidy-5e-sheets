D&D 5e sheet layouts for Foundry VTT, focused on a clean UI, user ergonomics, and extensibility.

Completely rewritten from the ground up, based on the [Tidy5e Sheet](https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet) module by [sdenec](https://github.com/sdenec) and [4535992](https://github.com/p4535992).

> **Warning**  
> **Use at your own risk.**
>
> This is an alpha testing module that is subject to numerous breaking changes and rapid updates.
>
> It is recommended that you do not alpha test these sheets on your actual game world.
>
> During alpha testing, various pieces of Tidy-specific data will not carry over from the original sheets to the alpha sheets and vice versa. If you have a sheet that is fully set up with the original Tidy 5e sheets, expect numerous fields to be reset to their default value when switching over to the new sheets.
> 
> These fields include but are not limited to:
> - Journal and journal note fields
> - Favorites
> - Sheet Lock
> - Skill Expand/Collapse
> - Traits Expand/Collapse
> - List/Grid View Preference
> - Search Filter text
> - NPC Exhaustion Level
> - NPC Personality view toggle

## How to Support Tidy 5e Sheets

Tidy 5e is a community effort. Development logs, feature discussion, troubleshooting, dreaming, and more can be found on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1167985253072257115/1167985253512650755). 

Sheets development is a longterm commitment, subject to every Foundry and dnd5e system update, so any support is greatly appreciated.

## Installation

During alpha testing, this module is installable manually by URL. It is not included in the Foundry modules list.

Manual installation instructions:

1. Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2. Click "Install Module"
3. In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
   `https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/releases/latest/download/module.json`
4. Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5. Enable the module in your game using the "Manage Module" button.
6. Select the sheet layout from these options, depending on which sheet you are using:
   - Tidy 5e kgar Character Sheet
   - Tidy 5e kgar NPC Sheet
   - Tidy 5e kgar Vehicle Sheet
   - Tidy 5e kgar Item Sheet

> **Important**  
> During alpha testing, I am using a temporary module ID, `tidy5e-sheet-kgar`, and as a result, these sheets are intended to sit alongside the current Tidy5e sheet layouts. When alpha testing is over, these sheets will become the official Tidy5e sheets, meaning **all settings related to these test sheets during alpha testing will be forgotten after alpha testing.**
>
> Your character/NPC/vehicle/item core data will remain intact. This is the data that is included with the dnd5e system. However, certain module-specific data that you set up for these alpha sheets such as config settings, favorites, NPC/vehicular exhaustion, vehicle movement status, search filter text, spellbook class filter selection, theme settings, etc., will be forgotten. There will not be a migration because of the sheer amount of work remaining to get these sheets to version 1 status.

## Alpha Testing Goals

- Ensure the essential features of the sheets work as intended
- Add some of the requested features from the [Tidy5e rewrite commission discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/732325252788387980/1116078321067892796)

## Tidy 5e Sheets Manifesto

- Tidy 5e Sheets are meant to be nice sheets that make it easy to do D&D in style.
- Tidy 5e Sheets are intended to remain compatible with the current version of the dnd5e system, including mirroring its Foundry compatibility settings. When there's a system update that has breaking changes, Tidy 5e Sheets will move all current efforts forward to the new dnd5e version and adjust its minimum system version accordingly.
- This module cannot and should not try to bootstrap all sheet-augmenting modules within its own source code. Modules come and go.
- This module should not become a Kitchen Sink module. Requests that go out of scope cannot be fulfilled.
- This is a community effort. The Maintainer(s) strive to keep an open dialogue with interested users / devs while continuing maintenance and adding features.
