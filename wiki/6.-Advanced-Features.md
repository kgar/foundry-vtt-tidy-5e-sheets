# Tab Selection

Tidy sheets support extensive tab customization and selection. Tidy lets you hide, show, and rearrange any tabs in *any sheet*.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for basic sheet functionality first? Check out [The Basics](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/wiki/2.-The-Basics) for essential features like Play/Edit modes and context menus.

1. In the Sheet Overflow menu &mdash; the three-dot menu in the top right of the Character sheet &mdash; select the **Tab Selection** option.
2. In the modal that appears, rearrange, hide, or show any tab on your sheet, including tabs from other modules.

Tab customization is per item/actor.

# Custom Sections

Custom sections allow you to organize character features and items beyond the default categories.

## Creating Custom Sections

Custom sections are managed per Tab. You can create custom sections in two ways:

1. Open an item sheet. At the bottom of the item sheet sidebar, you can choose to change two custom sections. The parent tab's section (e.g. Inventory), or the Actions section. Actions in the new sheets refers to the Actor's main tab section (Sheet for Characters, Statblock for NPCs).
2. Open the item's context menu using the three dot menu on the end of the row, or by right-clicking, then choose the "Choose a `TABNAME` Section" option.

## Section Management

After creating a custom section, you can add items directly into the section and drag and drop items into the section.

- **Custom sections are configured  per tab.**
- **Show or hide sections** using the Configure Tab button in the top right of each tab (the button showing a gear icon ⚙️).
- **Reorder sections** by dragging and dropping or by using the Configure Tab button (⚙️).
Custom Sections support drag and drop functionality beyond just sorting. Here are the functional rules for custom section drag and drop:

## Section Drag and Drop Behavior

- When dragging an unowned item onto a sheet, it will be added in the standard way, and it will use its configured section, whether custom or default.
- Dropping an unowned item onto a custom section does not transfer the item to the section.
- Dropping an owned item onto another item in the same section simply reorders the item per standard Foundry functionality.
- Dropping an owned item into a different custom section transfers the item to the new custom section, and it sorts the item if it were dropped onto another item, per standard Foundry functionality.
- Dropping an owned item into a default section causes the item's custom section to be cleared out.
- Dragging and dropping an item from one sheet to another uses the standard Foundry item drop behavior of copying the item, and the new item is created with the custom section intact.

# Inline Containers

Any Container in your sheets can be expanded and directly inside other tables without needing to open the Container sheet. Inline Containers feature:

- Drag and Drop organization
- Nested items, including nested inline containers!
- Visual hierarchy indicators
- Direct access to contained items

# Banked Inspiration

To enable banked inspiration, first enable it in Tidy's Settings.

1. Enable banked inspiration by opening Foundry's settings, opening the Tidy 5e Sheets settings, pressing the **Configure Homebrew** button.
2. Check the **Enable Banked Inspiration** option, optionally restricting it to DMs only, then save your changes.

Manage banked inspiration in one of two ways
1. In the Character sheet, open the Context Menu for a Feature item with limited uses (right-click or three-dot menu) and choose to **Set as Inspiration Source**.
2. Or, use a module like [So Inspired!](https://github.com/mysurvive/so-inspired)
