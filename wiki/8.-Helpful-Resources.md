# Max Prepared Spells Formulas

The maximum number of prepared spells for casters with spell preparation can vary by class, subclass, temporary effects, feats, and boons. This page is intended for additional user-submitted formulas that can help others automate their max prepared spells calculations.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a formula to submit to this wiki, create a [github issue](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/issues) with the formula and what class/subclass/scenario it pertains to. The main requirement is that it pertains to maximum prepared spells.
