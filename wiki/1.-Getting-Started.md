Get started with Tidy5e sheets in one of three ways:
1. [Change a specific sheet](#change-an-existing-sheet-to-tidy)
2. [Set Tidy as the default for a specific sheet type](#set-the-default-for-a-specific-sheet-type)
3. [Set Tidy as the default for all your sheets](#set-the-default-for-all-sheets)

Tidy supports the following sheet types:

- Character Sheets
- NPC Sheets
- Vehicle Sheets (Classic)
- Group Sheets
- Item Sheets / Container Sheet

&nbsp;

# Change an Existing Sheet to Tidy

If you have any sheet open and want to switch it to use Tidy, this is the quickest route. You're working directly with that specific document's sheet configuration.

1. Find the vertical three-dot Context Menu button at the top of your sheet. You'll see **Toggle Controls** when you hover over it.
2. Click the three-dot menu to open it, then select the **Configure Sheet** option with the gear icon (⚙️).
3. In the Sheet Configuration modal that opens, use the **This Sheet** dropdown to choose the Tidy sheet you'd like to use, **Tidy5e Character Sheet** for actors or **Tidy5e Item Sheet** for items.
4. Press **Save** to change the sheet for that specific document.

# Set the Default for a Specific Sheet Type

You can also change the default sheet for all new sheets of a particular type. Change the default sheet for a document type in the same way as changing an individual sheet.

1. Find the vertical three-dot Context Menu button at the top of your sheet. You'll see **Toggle Controls** when you hover over it.
2. Click the three-dot menu to open it, then select the **Configure Sheet** option with the gear icon (⚙️).
3. In the Sheet Configuration modal that opens, use the **Default Sheet** dropdown to choose the Tidy sheet you'd like to use, **Tidy5e Character Sheet** for actors or **Tidy5e Item Sheet** for items.
4. Press **Save**. Now any new sheets of this document type will use Tidy automatically.

This method is convenient because it sets the default for whatever type of document you're currently viewing. If you're on a character sheet, it sets the character default. If you're on an item sheet, it sets the item default.

# Set the Default for All Sheets

## Tidy's Settings Menu

1. Navigate to Foundry's **Game Settings** in the application sidebar, then press the **Configure Settings** button.
2. Select the **Tidy 5e Sheets** option in the Game Settings modal.
3. Press the **Set Tidy as Default Sheet** button.
4. Select any or all the sheets you'd like to change to Tidy sheets, including PCs, NPCs, Items, Facilities, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> As of version 10.2.1, this bulk setting defaults to the Classic sheet since the newer Quadrone sheets are still in beta, but that'll probably change once Quadrone is fully released. Confirm your choices and accept the reload when prompted.

## Foundry's Core Settings

1. Navigate to Foundry's **Game Settings** in the application sidebar, then press the **Configure Settings** button.
2. Stay in the **Core** option in the sidebar, which is selected by default.
3. Scroll down to the Default Document Sheets field and press the **Configure Default Sheets** button.
4. This opens up a more detailed interface where you can set defaults for different document types. Tidy provides sheets for the Actors (characters, NPCs, vehicles, groups) and Items sections.
5. Select any or all the sheets you'd like to change to Tidy sheets, including PCs, NPCs, Items, Facilities, and more.

# What Works Best?

Foundry's Core Settings approach gives you the most granular control over exactly which sheets you want to use. The Tidy Settings menu is faster for bulk changes across multiple document types. The individual sheet method works well when you're already working with a specific type and want to set the default for just that category.

Most people find success starting with the individual sheet method to test things out, then using either the Tidy settings menu for quick bulk changes or the core settings for precise control. If you run into any issues switching between sheet types, remember that you can always go back through the same configuration menus to change things again - nothing here is permanent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember that Foundry's **This Sheet** setting affects just the document (item, actor) you have open, while **Default Sheet** affects all new documents of that type going forward.
