# Play and Edit Modes

Tidy gives players and DMs easy ways to view or edit sheets. 

- **Play Mode**: Locked mode for normal gameplay.
- **Edit Mode**: Unlocked mode for editing character or item details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Players default to Play Mode. DMs default to Edit Mode.

- Switch modes using the **Lock Switch** in the top left of a sheet.
- Add a keyboard shorcut to toggle modes using the **Toggle Sheet Lock** setting in Foundry's **Configure Controls** settings. We recommend setting this to **`L`** to quickly switch modes.
- View or Edit an item from the **Context Menu**.
- **Double-click** an item row to View.
- **Middle-click** an item to Edit, including from Play Mode.
